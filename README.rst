******************
Django Boilerplate
******************

Personal boilerplate for Django projects.

I use postgres and pytest because they are quite standardized in the community. It is not too dificult to switch to other tools anyway.

As a side note, this project lives on <https://gitlab.com/daniel777/django-boilerplate> and it's mirrored to `GitHub <https://github.com/daniel777-coder/django-boilerplate>`_.

Usage
=====

Install cookiecuter if you have not installed it yet:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install --user cookiecutter

Generate the project:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cookiecutter gl:daniel777/django-boilerplate
