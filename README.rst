*************************
Django Simple Boilerplate
*************************

Personal boilerplate for Django projects.

This boilerplate was designed to be as simple as possible, giving you the freedom to provide templates, APIs, websockets, etc. as required.

We use postgres and pytest because they are quite standardized in the community. It is not too dificult to switch to other tools anyway.

As a side note, this project lives on <https://gitlab.com/daniel777/django-simple-boilerplate> and it's mirrored to `GitHub <https://github.com/daniel777-coder/django-simple-boilerplate>`_.
